This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of operational performance at a food manufacturing company, covering key areas such as production output, shift performance, material quality, operator efficiency, and machine conditions.
Over 5,000 batches were recorded across morning, evening, and night shifts, with detailed tracking of defect rates, batch durations, and product-specific performance. The data also includes material quality breakdowns, supplier contributions, and machine sensor analysis â€” including overheating events, temperature spikes, and pressure anomalies.
By consolidating this information into a single, interactive Power BI dashboard, the company now has a centralized tool for monitoring trends, identifying issues, and supporting data-driven decisions across operations.
